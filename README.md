## 🎯 **Mission Statement**

DarkwebCTI aims to provide cybersecurity professionals, threat researchers, and analysts with actionable intelligence from underground ecosystems. This repository focuses on data-driven approaches to understanding cybercriminal infrastructure, tactics, and emerging threats.

## 🔍 **What is Cyber Threat Intelligence?**

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the collection, processing, and analysis of information about current and potential attacks that threaten organizations. It provides evidence-based knowledge about adversaries' intentions, capabilities, and opportunities.

**Our Focus Areas:**
- **Strategic CTI**: High-level threat landscape analysis and emerging trends
- **Tactical CTI**: Adversary TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) 
- **Operational CTI**: Real-time threat actor activities and campaigns
